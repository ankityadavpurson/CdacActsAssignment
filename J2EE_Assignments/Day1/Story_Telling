advanced java.
1. most of people it means the following.
1. knowing power of reflection.
2. using frameworks.
3. knowing architectures 

	1. jee -- standard
	2. spring framework  -- product
	3. hibernate.  -- product

how we plan to approach.
1. we will learn spring framework.
coming sunday evening.
spring framework is very good example
of good design. 2003,  2014


2. hibernate is better option to deal
with database when compared to jdbc.
hibernate is only a dao stuff.

3. jee   -- standard thru whcih we can
build java based enterprise applications.

jee is 1997 stuff, the reason why java
is so powerful in the enterprise world.

how do you take some body english and know whether is correct information
or wrong information.


difference between core java and
advanced java.
in core java you write main
in advaned java you cannot write main.


spring (3/5)
hibernate (2.5/5)
jee (2/5)

tool usage
maven
log4j
git.
jenkins



jee
enterprise applciation
1. large number of usres
2. security needs.
3 variety of clients
4. legacy issues. -- old software.
...

jee advantage.
1. generic things are taken care by
a software called container.
2. programmer will cook things
whcih are specific to his project.
3. 1 +2 is what the client will see.

any jee platform will be component based.
there are various components which we choose depends on need.

transport system.
cycle, bullock cart, car, bike ... crane. boat, ship...

which one you want to pick you have to decide.

when too much of infomration, stick
with basics.

what is spring?
1. it makes applciations loosely coupled
2. anythign with spring , that anything
will become easier.
X+ spring = X becomes easier.


drawback of spring, it is a product.
spring is free, hopefuly it will be free.

once upon a time java was free, now it is not free, becuse drug business.

loosely coupled word meaning.
some kids wants to electronic kits
now the kid should not ask for soldering rod. in case the kid kid will burn himself.



bread board  -- spring software breadboard.
you can plug and play anything provided
you know interface.





Torch , bulb and battery.

spring framework.
Torch and buld i want tight coupling
Battery and Torch loose coupling.

in which layer spring is used.
answer is in all layers, I hate this.
ok spring can be used in service layer
and dao layer.




should I use nodejs or Spring , great question usually nodejs and spring bad
options.






I want to work on advanced java things
what all things should I know.

1. somethings are coded.
2. somethings are configured
3. you need libraries   -- add libraries
by ourselves for thre edays till sunday.
on monday we will go for maven.


maven is a tool which helps you in
getting the libraries,assembling code, compiling code and deploying code.



tools known -- maven, log4j,junit, git,jenkins.

spring framework.

many a times framework will use
configuration files.
these configuration files has to be
put in the classpath. best to ensrue
something is in the classpath while
working in eccclipse is copy the configuration file in the src folder.
in the src folder and not inside some folder of src.










1. what is first thing i should do while
working on spring.

1. copy some jar files into our project
so that can jvm can locate it.
put your jar files in the CLASSPATH.

jar files should be there, but we doing
project --properites add jar file pathetic approach but currently great
appraoch.
xml file is called as configuration file.






1. copyied the jar files addthat
into the project.
2. configuration src folder.
gurantee there in my classpath.





java bean.
what is java bean
normal java class with setter and getter.
i will show creating vity on setter
and getter ok it is no longer a bean

when does it know whrether it use intel
or amd. it wont know
we should know
.









i should have two clases, A or B.
but  both of them should have a function
called f1, this english can be done
only if you design an interface with
f1 and ensure A and B implement it.



Car and wheels
Cabinet and processor


whole  -- Cabinet.
Processor -- interface.





is spring wired object and domain
object the same  thing?

what do you mean domain object.
that object that is common for all layers

spring object.
object created by spring.


who tells spring which object to create.







you have some classes with you.
you decide which objects you
will create, which objects spring
will create.
then you decide what you will wire
what spring will wire.
and then finally in the code, pickup
the spring wired object  becuase that
is reason why we used spring.

spring gives loose couplilng but talented programmer can write tight
couplilng with spring also. that is skill
we cant compete.







































Mobile has sim.
sim have two implementations Airtel
and BSNL
Mobile has a function sendSMS

wiring of airtel sim or bsnl sim should
be done by spring into the Mobile.

mobileobject.sendSMS
send sms using bsnl/airtel sim.







does thre tier have association.
Prsentation has a SErvice
SErvice hsa a dao
DAO has a database.


people who become afan of loose coupling
will be in hell. 



again the most popular virus will
attack us.
most popular virus == inability to getinto details.
